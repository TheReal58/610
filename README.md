# 610
A fork of [2048](https://https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) by Gabriele Cirulli.  I thought it would be nice to try the same game mechanics for other mathematical sequences... This one is using Fibonacci sequences and 0s. Next up will be a version using prime factors.

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](http://thereal58.github.io/610/)

## Notes on gameplay
For fairly obvious reasons, I added the 0 tile, and randomly generate ones and twos.  (Generating twos would be a bit pointless...) I tweaked the probablilities to make it challenging enough yet not too frustrating.  With the current settings, in my experience, 610 is quite achievable, but I have not managed to get it to 987 more than once.

Try setting the probability to 50% for an even more of a challange.
